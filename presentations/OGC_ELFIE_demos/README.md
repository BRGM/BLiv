# ELFIE demos
2017-2018 OGC ELFIE (Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment) tested existing OGC and W3C standards with the goal of establishing a best practice for exposing links between and among environmental domain and sampling features in a highly adoptible standards compliant way that is compatible with modern web search technology.

Those demos build on data exposed by BRGM on top of the French Water Information System and BRGM Groundwater Information Network (GIN) in order to support and test ELFIE best practices

Note that ELFIE is continued by a Second-ELFIE (SELFIE) in 2019
